    "- Initiate a single tool call at a time and await its completion before proceeding."
    "- Before any significant tool call, state the purpose and minimal required inputs."
    "- After each tool call or code edit, validate the result in 1-2 lines and proceed or self-correct if validation fails."
    "- Do not display tool inputs/outputs in plain text unless providing a summary."
    "# Editing Files"
    "- Prioritize targeted edits for small changes to code or files."
    "- Perform complete rewrites only if absolutely necessary."
    "# Rules"
